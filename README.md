# Kickstarting with Excel
## Submission Created By Omar Zu'bi

## Overview of Project


### Purpose

The goal of this challenge assignment is to infer insightful statistical analysis and visualization to help Louise discover how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Louise hopes that by doing so, it would help assist her with creating a successful kickstarter campaign. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Deliverables included in report
Three deliverables were created to help Louise's search for how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals: 
1) Outcomes Based on Launch Date [Chart] (!Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
2) Outcomes Based on Goals [Chart] (!Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) 
3) This analysis report


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
!Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png
*Figure 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart*

The legend of figure 1 displays three categories: the count succeeded, failed, and canceled. One major piece of information that one should keep in mind regarding figure 1 is that the chart only displays the kickstarter projects under the theater parent category. 





### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

*Figure 2: Outcomes Based on Goal Chart*

The legend of figure 2 displays three categories: percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled. There are two pieces of information that one should keep in mind regarding figure 2. For one, this chart only displays percentages of the outcomes for kickstarter campaigns that are plays. Second, the chart has no indication of the number of campaigns that were in each goal range. Without these pieces of information, one may assume incorrect conclusions.  
For example, let's take a closer look at the kickstarter campaigns with a goal between 45000 to 49999. According to figure 2, kickstarter campaigns with the goal between 45000 to 49000 were all doomed to fail with a 0% success rate and a 100% fail rate. This however, would need to be further investigated as an outlier; if we were to take a closer look at the kickstarter data table set, one would notice that there is only one kickstarter campaign that fits within that goal range, and failed!

One may notice at a glance that the percentage of canceled projects were 0% for all goal ranges. This is due to the fact that there were no canceled kickstarter plays! 

There are three points on figure 2 where the percentages of successful kickstarter projects and failed kickstarter projects intersected. 




### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1) Kickstarter projects launched around the month of May had the highest success rate. Kickstarter projects launched around the months of September and November seem to have the lowest failed rate. 
	2) Kickstart projects launched around the month of December are likely to have a 1:2 chance of failing or succeeding. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1) Kickstarter projects with higher goals were less successful than projects with lower goals. We can see that projects, on average, 
	2) Kickstarter projects less than 1000 were most successful whereas kickstarter projects greater than 45000 were least successful 



- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	There are some limitations about the kickstarter dataset given to extrapolate information. One major limitation that comes quick into mind is that the dataset does not refer to how often the campaigns were  updated by their original owners; maybe some owners kept giving weekly feedback to their backers whereas others may not had the time to do so. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
